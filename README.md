Ideation and design of a controller to ensure trajectory tracking for mobile robots with safety constraints using control logic based on Switching Programming utilizing Control Barrier Functions. Also a controller based on the Quadratic programming is implemented.

The repository is organized in the following way:
- Video : contains the video of the animation;
- PlotsSimulazioni: contains the plots of the simulations both for RobotPuntiforme and RobotRaggioRR;
- RobotPuntiformeCode: contains the Matlab code to implement the controller for a point-like robot;
- RobotRaggioRRCode: contains the Matlab code to implement the controller for a robot of radius RR;
